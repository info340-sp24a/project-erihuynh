            <p>
                Inspired by other viral personality tests, such as the <a href="https://ooopenlab.cc/quiz/tnktDkj2opl5kCRUunbC">Cake Resume</a>, Taiwan Expo, and <a href="https://4rchiv3.github.io/CosmosPersona/">Cosmos</a> tests, we want to create a personality test web application that will allow the user to discover their unique personality traits in a fun and engaging way. Our goal is to provide an immersive experience that not only reveals insights about the userâ€™s personality in an entertaining way but also educates them about different aspects of personality psychology. These persona/personality quizzes serve as an easy and fun way to get to know and connect with others better, whether friends or someone new, and we take these quizzes because they might reveal previously unknown information about ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the timeframe is too short to base the personality test on extensive research, we still want to draw inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">MBTI</a>. Unlike other applications, our application will allow the user to save their results by logging in, so if they need to reference their personality type, the user will not have to retake the test. Additionally, other applications include the quiz itself, but we want to also include a searchable gallery of the different persona types and their description that are attainable.
