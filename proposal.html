            <p>
                Inspired by other viral personality tests, such as the <a href="https://ooopenlab.cc/quiz/tnktDkj2opl5kCRUunbC">Cake Resume</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231006112345/https://event.designexpo.org.tw/en/">Taiwan Expo</a>, and <a href="https://4rchiv3.github.io/CosmosPersona/">Cosmos</a> tests, we want to create a personality test web application that will allow the user to discover their unique personality traits in a fun and engaging way. Our goal is to provide an immersive experience that not only reveals insights about the user’s personality in an entertaining way but also educates them about different aspects of personality psychology. These persona/personality quizzes serve as an easy and fun way to get to know and connect with others better, whether friends or someone new, and we take these quizzes because they might reveal previously unknown information about ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the timeframe is too short to base the personality test on extensive research, we still want to draw inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">MBTI</a>. Unlike other applications, our application will allow the user to save their results by logging in, so if they need to reference their personality type, the user will not have to retake the test. Additionally, other applications include the quiz itself, but we want to also include a searchable gallery of the different persona types and their description that are attainable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our identified problem area relates to icebreakers and their effectiveness. In areas like the school clubs or professional workspaces, it can be difficult for people to integrate into a new team and get to know each other. While current icebreaker games online, such as Kahoot, do exist, oftentimes people walk away from the game feeling as if they didn’t really get to know other people as well as they hoped. We aim to solve this problem by creating an online quiz maker that anyone can participate in and share with others.             
            </p>
            <p>
                On our web app, users will be able to create their own quiz, search for quizzes others have made, and take/submit those quizzes. We wanted to provide a central hub where people can customize their own quizzes to add variety to the types of icebreaker questions available online. Additionally, we also saw positive feedback in customization across other platforms like Kahoot and Quotev believing it’d be a great addition to our design.

                    <h3>Impact & Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through our application, users will be able to gain a deeper understanding of their personality type. The application will likely attract people who are interested in self-discovery or personal development, such as students or working professionals. In considering minority groups, it’s imperative to recognize potential impacts of representation, bias, and accessibility. Personality type results should be inclusive in representing diverse identities to ensure accuracy and acknowledge varying experiences and backgrounds. Reinforcing biases should additionally be avoided to prevent any discrimination that can be harmful to minority groups. We must also design the web app with accessibility in mind, so users can easily navigate and engage with the quiz.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We expect to include interactive features that will allow the user to progress through quiz questions to receive a personality type, allow the user to search and filter through other different personalities, and provide a login functionality for users to save their results. Users will be viewing and responding to quiz questions with a variety of responses that the user can select from. Their answers are then used to determine their personality type. After receiving their results, they can browse and filter through the other personality types and can sign in to save their results. In creating this web application, we have the opportunity to design and craft a personality quiz that addresses personal development to better comprehend our experiences and identities. By considering minority groups, accessibility, and broad ranges of people, we can have a stronger grasp on our individuality and others’.
